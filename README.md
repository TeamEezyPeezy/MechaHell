# MechaHell

MechaHell is a 2D Top Down Wave Based Survival Shooter, in which you play as a Mecha surviving in an isolated space station against endless waves of aliens. 

- Survive as many waves as you can and compete against other players for the top leaderboard rankings.

- Upgrade your weaponry and abilities by blasting aliens and finding the different upgrade terminals scattered throughout the space station.
